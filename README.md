Snake with 3 difficulty levels and an online leaderboard.

Note that if you want the online leaderboard you have to download the game from the [Release](https://github.com/AndrexoHD/SimpleSnake/releases) section.
If you don't want to do that you can [implement](https://github.com/AndrexoHD/SimpleSnake/blob/3c288d531f89560114905d6eab3cca7c063c49d7/src/JSONLeaderboard.java#L14) your own JSON real-time database.
