Snake with 3 difficulty levels and an online leaderboard.

Note that if you want the online leaderboard you have to download the game from the [Release](https://github.com/AndrexoHD/SimpleSnake/releases) section.
If you don't want to do that you can [implement](https://github.com/AndrexoHD/SimpleSnake/blob/8a3c0bc0a40d964b89c3a67bf189461cbdb1cedf/src/JSONLeaderboard.java#L14) your own JSON real-time database.
